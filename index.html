                            <p> Worked on applications in the healthcare domain for the State of Florida health department. One
                              of these applications was developed for providing a portal to the citizens of Florida to schedule
                              an appointment for COVID-19 vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were two more
                              applications made for the program administrators and site staff for the management of the
                              vaccination processes taking place on a daily basis. For more information visit <a href="https://www.springml.com/press/vaccine-scheduling-for-the-state-of-florida/" target="_blank">springml.com/press/vaccine-scheduling-for-the-state-of-florida/</a>.<br></p>

                            <p>This project features two different chatbots designed to assist with hospital operations. The first is a basic chatbot,
                               and the second is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot, integrated with hospital-specific data extracted from PDF files.
                               The RAG chatbot is powered by Amazon's Titan LLM (amazon.titan-text-lite-v1) and is capable of answering detailed questions related to hospital operations.
                               This project utilizes Amazon's Bedrock service to interact with the model for generating responses. It can also read and extract text from scanned handwritten images,
                               convert them to PDFs, and utilize this information in responses(does this with the help of pytesseract library).</p>
